# Ideal-MHD-Solver
This code solves the 1d ideal MHD equations in either cartesian or cylindrical coordinate systems

# Run Instructions
Add all of the folders to the local matlab path by right-clicking on the folders and selecting "add to path". Then run the MHD_solver script.

# Changing Parameters
To change input parameters, navigate to the top of the MHD_solver script. Here, there are options to alter domain parameters, time parameters, adiabatic index, the geometry of the problem (cartesian vs. cylindrical), initial conditions, and the runge-kutta solver. Note: In cylindrical geometry, the leftmost spatial coordinate must be 0.

# Selecting initial conditions
To change the intial condition to one of the pre-existing options, navigate to the top of the MHD_solver scipt and select the number input corresponding to the intended initial condition.
